# gitam_campus

The project is about finding the shortest path in a map, 

It is done by using the Dijkstra's Algorithm, which uses a dictionary with the adjacency list of the map.

Execute the `main.py` file, and you will be shown all the available locations, between which the project finds the shortest path.

The `Campus Navigation  Pathfinding and Mapping using Dijkstra.pdf` attached documentation, provides all the information from control flow, logic breakdown, file descriptions to usage instructions.

Go though that and ping for any queries.
